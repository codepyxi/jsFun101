Difference between Git and GitHub:
Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13321556/difference-between-git-and-github
Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history.
GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.
So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.
